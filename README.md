# Warranty
There is no guarantee that these codes works. 
I have no responsibility on any of the consequences arising from modifying,running, and distributing this code.

# Warning

There is nothing amazing happening right now. It is under development, and there is no actual profits or real-time signaling properties
so far. It will happen.

There is no GUI cuz I have no idea how to do that.

# Dependencies
`python 2.7` and packages that can be installed with `pip` (I'll make an official list). 
I'm a python noob, so I don't know when it will be. It would be nice if I can make some `setup.py`.

# How to use

## Shaping data

Go to 

`http://www.histdata.com/download-free-forex-historical-data/?/ninjatrader/tick-last-quotes/usdjpy/`

Download the zip files for all the month from January of 2015 up to now, extract, and put the csv files in 

`./data/tickdata/rawdata/`

Go in to the folder `shapedata` run 

`python truncatenight.py`
and 
`python shapetwosec.py`

This will generate a csv files with all the USD/JPY data in an interval of 1 second
(note that the linear extrapolation is taken for missing data points).

## Making AI
Go to tensorflow folder,
and run `makeAI-tf.py`. make sure to turn `cont_learn` to `= False` at line `23` if you are running it for the first time.

Once `saved!` is displayed on a terminal (the command window), run `backtest.py` and see how it goes.
tweak `checkQ` to be `= True` to see how Q-values changes over transactions as a graph.

you need to have this trained at least 100,000 times to see a good progress (still not enough, I think). 

Enjoy.

### sklearn version is obsolete. 
run 
`make-AI-skl.py` this will create a base AI
then run
`prob_clas.py` this takes a probability distribution of the base AI and make further predictions.
then run
`backtest.py` to conduct backtesting.
